	This project aims to create an actionable dashboard listing the TLS configurations of certain websites where good security is expected.
	This uses the <a href="https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/stable/ssllabs-api-docs.md">API</a> from <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html">Qualys SSL Labs Server Test</a>
	to evaluate a site's TLS configuration and displays its grade. Issues with a site's TLS configuration that prevent it from obtaining an 'A' grade or better are highlighted.
